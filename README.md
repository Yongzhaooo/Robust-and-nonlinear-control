The Course is finished till now.
I will delay the upload of the latest assignment (to avoid plagiarism) to update this repository.

For the lab, I uploaded a video showing the robust controller performance for the pendulum.

10/3
The course now already dived into a zone where really complex problems arise... 

Hope I can apply the knowledge in life later, or will be a waste (sigh
